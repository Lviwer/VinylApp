If you want save vinyls in database comment  the dropTable() method in initDatabase()
method from DbManager class. ONCE TIME. Every second time will generate errors. (You can't create
second time the same objects so you must turn off loading vinyls by program like below).


To turn off loading vinyls by program - comment FillDatabase.fillDatabase() method in
enterOnAction() method from LoginWindowController class.

more info later...
